/**
 * This version of the resume pulls all of the data from .json files. Work, skills,
 * and education can be modified just by updating these files.
 *
 * All of the major sections are imported from their own JSX components.
 * Experience, Education, and Skills all get their own file. The smaller components
 * are bundled into Profile.jsx
 *
 * The styles rely heavily on Bootstrap for layout, including a "responsive"
 * design. This page has a 2-column layout for most screens, but shrinks to a
 * single column for small screens.
